### Hi, I'm Caden ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Student Reseacher at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, MN.

My interests are scientific computing, computational chemistry, and research software engineering.

I've worked at [Dr. Dwight Stoll's Lab](https://dwightstoll.wixsite.com/drstoll) developing chromatography tools, [Dr. Jonathan Sweedler](https://sweedler-lab.chemistry.illinois.edu/)'s Lab analyzing multidimensional proteomics data, and finally for Dr. Janie Frandsen analyzing transcriptomics data (DMS-MAPseq) for non-coding RNA structure/function relationships. 

Finally you can find source codes for [my occasional Game Jams](https://itch.io/c/1047096/games-ive-worked-on) here. ðŸ‘¾
