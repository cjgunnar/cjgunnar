### Hi, I'm Caden ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Student Reseacher at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, MN.

My interests are biochemistry, scientific computing, bioinformatics, and research software engineering.

I've worked at [Dr. Dwight Stoll's Lab](https://dwightstoll.wixsite.com/drstoll) developing [chromatography tools](https://www.multidlc.org/kinetic_plot_tool/), [Dr. Jonathan Sweedler](https://sweedler-lab.chemistry.illinois.edu/)'s Lab analyzing multidimensional proteomics data, and finally for Dr. Janie Frandsen analyzing transcriptomics data (DMS-MAPseq) for non-coding RNA structure/function relationships. 

You can also find [my occasional Game Jams](https://itch.io/c/1047096/games-ive-worked-on) here. ðŸ‘¾
